# Scam Protect

### [Dev Post](https://devpost.com/software/scam-protect?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)

### Inspiration

The inspiration behind Scam Protect came from Mark Rober's clever response to scammers with his glitter bomb. We wanted to take that ingenuity into the digital realm to protect people from online scams in a proactive and dynamic way.

### What it does

Scam Protect injects a dynamic warning page into potentially suspicious sites, alerting users before they can proceed. This warning is aimed at giving possible victims a chance to reconsider before interacting with what may be a fraudulent site.

### How we built it

The project was built using JavaScript for the dynamic page injection. We employed MongoDB for data management, Google Cloud for seamless deployment, and the Gemini API to fine-tune our custom support agent that interacts with users in real-time.

### Challenges we ran into

Integrating the Gemini API into the project was a challenging task, requiring careful handling of the API's functionality to meet our specific needs for scam protection.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are incredibly proud of the UI and how the app turned out after all components were successfully integrated. The end result is a seamless experience that enhances user protection without disrupting their browsing experience.

### What we learned

Through this project, we gained in-depth knowledge of fine-tuning Gemini for real-world use cases and learned about the architecture required to build a dynamic end-to-end web application.

### What's next for Scam Protect

We are excited about future developments, which include integrating dynamic URL scanning with a probability model. This will allow Scam Protect to auto-inject warnings whenever a high probability of a scam site is detected.
